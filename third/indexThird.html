            Son of a gun. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
Just use the old one inch brush. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Here's something that's fun. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.
